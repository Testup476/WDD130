            The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a large central African country rich in minerals like cobalt
            and copper.
            Its capital is Kinshasa, and French is the official language. The DRC has a diverse population, vast
            rainforests, and
            the Congo River, but it faces challenges like political instability and regional conflicts. Despite this, it
            is
            culturally vibrant and has great development potential.
